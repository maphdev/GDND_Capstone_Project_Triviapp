# Capstone Project: Triviapp !

Sixth and final project of Udacity's Android Nanodegree.

Triviapp is an application used to kill time and to educate yourself while still having a blast. It is a trivia app that asks a lot of questions from music, to mythology, history and sports, just to name a few. The principle is simple, you answer questions one after one in order to score the highest score possible. And because everyone has their own liking, the user can choose to either receive questions from random categories, or a category of their choosing.
